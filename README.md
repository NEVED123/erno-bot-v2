# Erno

I'm Erno, inventor of the Rubik's Cube. I have been turned into a discord bot to tell members of the Oakland University Rubik's Cube Club about upcoming competitions in Michigan!

This is the second version of the bot. The new version has been written as a lambda function to save on costs, and all storage is in a DynamoDB for a better long-term storage solution. Also, refactors have made the code much easier to maintain.
